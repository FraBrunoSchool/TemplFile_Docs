# Flask

> Flask is a Web micro-framework written in Python, based on the Werkzeug WSGI tool and with the Jinja2 template engine. It is BSD licensed.
>Flask is a micro-framework because it has a simple but extensible core. There is no abstraction layer for the database, form validation, or any other component to provide common functionality for which third-party libraries already exist. However, Flask supports extensions that can add functionality to an application as if it were implemented by Flask itself. For example, there are extensions for form validation, file upload management, various authentication technologies, and more.
